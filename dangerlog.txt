Got some errer in database part. Because query for creating database used ORDER and LIMIT, which are two words that reserved by postgres. 
Solved it by changing these words to ORDERS and PRICE.

Account with insufficient amount can also create order, which is not correct. 
The problem is that, when trying to get the account amount, there is no checking if there is such symbol for that account, so it just get a random number.
Solved by checking the size of the query result first, then doing corresponding operation.

Have problems when doing parallel running. Always have the problem that 'Started nontransaction while transaction<READ COMMITTED> still active'
It is because a transaction or a nontransaction is not closed before another one wants to open. 
But the database code has no problem, all transactions and nontransactions are closed after using. 
So we need to add a lock. After add lock to the read xml function, problem solved.

Had segmentation fault when compose docker. Because the database name is not matched. 
Solved by match the names in file, also delete images to rerun.
